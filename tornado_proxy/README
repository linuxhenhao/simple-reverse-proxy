tornado using httpclient.fetch to fetch request,
nothing in the callback class that call fetch including self.request 
will send to httpclient.fetch function underground.

so the fetch function only uses  params given to it,request is necessary,
other things such as headers are optional.

Thus, if we want to do something like this:
fetch from host A,but using info in request.headers['host'] to identify the server;
We do this 
client.fetch('https?://realhost/xxx',headers),the server name should be stored in headers
realhost is where the client should fetch contents from
