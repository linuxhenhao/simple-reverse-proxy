now google will do bot check every first time a browser open scholar.
google.com from my vps server, So I need solve this problem by deal
with the 'Location' returned by the scholar.google.com

Now,Location replace by my own ipv4.xxx.com is working.
But when fetch_url do fetch from ipv4.google.com,though the server 
return the bot check image and other content, the HTTPResponse.code 
is 503.
/////Tornado think this is an erro and abort the fetch work,
/////SOLVE THIS!!!
